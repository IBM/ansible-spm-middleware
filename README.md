## Overview

Collections are a distribution format for Ansible content. You can use collections to package and distribute playbooks, roles, modules, and plugins.
You can publish and use collections through `Ansible Galaxy <https://galaxy.ansible.com/merative>`.

Assumption for having collection as a repo, is it enable reuse of content as well, such repo can be easily used separately by just adding `ansible.cfg`.

## Collection structure

Collections follow a simple data structure. None of the directories are required unless you have specific content that belongs in one of them. A collection does require a ``galaxy.yml`` file at the root level of the collection. This file contains all of the metadata that Galaxy
and other tools need in order to package, build and publish the collection::
